    <p>I will use this space to introduce myself now</p>
    <p>
      I am 24, an Aquarius, so I'll let you guess my birthday based off that
      information. I was born and bred on the sunny East Coast. Well, it hasn’t
      been very sunny as of late, but yeah. I am autistic, so that brings a lot
      of challenges for me when it comes to social situations that I’m not used
      to. But, in saying that it does give me a good eye for detail and helps me
      be the ultra creative that I am. According to th VIA strengths finder, my
      top strength is that I have a love for learning, which I think is
      definitely true. I have a little black cat who keeps me on my toes, but I
      love her. I look forward to studying with y’all and seeing where this
      course takes me.

    <p>Watch this space, I promise I'll make it worth your time</p>
