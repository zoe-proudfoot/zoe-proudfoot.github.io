# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
The set-up was difficult to start with. But once I got past those obstacles, I was on a roll. When I got stuck for too long, I would step away from my screen for a while and then come back to it with a fresh perspective. So far, that has worked for me every time and I do hope that it continues helping me throughout the course.
### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I feel pretty confident with the Learning Competencies. While I do have a ways to go, I think I've done pretty good so far.
### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
I have enjoyed using the Visual Studio Code programme to do my work. It has what I need to do with my work. It even has an option for me to pull up my Ubuntu Terminal when I need to, which I do like to utilize a lot.
### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
As much as I have enjoyed using VSC and answering these questions and the ones on my reflections file, typing out everything gets irritating after a while.
### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
As a creative person, I ALWAYS have been very critical of myself. That voice is always telling me that I can be better, or create better things. In a way, that voice is often right because we are human and we are constantly learning ways to create better, or in the case of software development, code better. We don't make progress if we don't critique ourselves ever so often. That's the way I see it anyway. 

### See you at the end of Sprint Two! Or sooner.
