    <h1>Foundations Reflections!</h1>
    <h4>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the core learning?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Through my core learning experience, I've encountered three new aspects
      about myself and my ego. Firstly, I realized that I tend to underestimate
      my abilities and achievements. While I value humility, I acknowledge the
      importance of recognizing and giving myself credit when it is deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, I've found that despite having autism and sometimes struggling
      with social cues, I posess emotional intellegce and the ability to be
      empathetic. This enables me to provide valuble support to the important
      people in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, I've come to realize that I thrive on routine, and I've
      successfully established a beneficial one during Foundations. However, I
      recognize the need to start my activities earlier to allow for more study
      time. I've discovered that my optimal focus hours begin around 10 AM when
      my mind is clear and funtioning at its best.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Values, empathy, and self awareness are crucial in learning and
      programming. Values guide ethical choices, empathy fosters user
      understanding, and self-awareness enhances decision-making and personal
      growth.
    </p>
    <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
    <p>
      I found the core learning experience to be surprisingly insightful,
      particularly in terms of self-discovery. I was amazed to realize that I
      possess emotional intelligence, despite initially doubting it.
      Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised by my ability to retain the newly
      acquired information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the core components, I particularly enjoyed working on the blogs and
      experimenting with CSS styling. It allowed me to tap into my creativity
      and even explore different writing styles. These aspects added an extra
      layer of enjoyment to the learning process.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What were some of the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The core learning experience presented several challenges for me. One of
      the most difficult aspects was engaging in verbal communication with
      others. As someone who is naturally socially awkward, interacting outside
      of written communication proved to be a struggle. Despite this, I made a
      sincere effort and will continue improving my people skills throughout
      Bootcamp.<br />' Another challenge I encountered was the guided meditation
      exercise during Sprint Three. It was difficult for me to stay focussed and
      prevent my mind from wandering. Additionally, I found it difficult to
      refrain from laughing at the voice of the instructor. However, I
      discovered that reading a few chapters from whatever romance novel Iâ€™m
      reading, which Google claims as meditation, combined with listening to my
      favorite heavy metal music, serves as a more enjoyable form of relaxation
      for me.

  <h4>
    Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
    focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
  </h4>
  <p>
    We prioritize core learning in our web development Bootcamp course because
    we recognize the importance of interpersonal skills alongside technical
    expertise. In any industry, including programming, the ability to
    effectively interact with others is paramount. Developers frequently
    collaborate with colleagues, work for clients, and engage in team projects.
    It is crucial to cultivate positive relationships and demonstrate
    professionalism. Even if one excels in website development, a negative
    attitude or disrespectful behavior can severely hinder professional success.
    By emphasizing core learning, we aim to equip our students with the
    essential skills to communicate effectively, collaborate efficiently, and
    build strong working relationships. This holistic approach enhances career
    prospects, fosters positive team dynamics, and contributes to overall
    professional growth.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
    time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead?
    Justify your answer.
  </h4>
  <p>
    No, I do not believe that the time spent studying core learning was a waste
    of time. While it is true that dedicating more time to programming practice
    could have been beneficial, the core learning components offered valuable
    insights and benefits that complement programming skills. <br />
    By engaging with emotional intelligence and neuroplasticity exercises, I
    gained a deeper understanding of myself and how I can improve as a
    programmer. These learnings helped me recognize the significance of people
    skills in the field of programming. Developing strong interpersonal
    abilities, such as effective communication and empathy, is essential for
    collaboration, teamwork, and client interactions. <br />
    Furthermore, core learning provided a holistic approach to my development as
    a professional. It expanded my perspective beyond coding and technical
    aspects, emphasizing the importance of personal growth, self-awareness, and
    professionalism. These elements contribute to long-term success and
    satisfaction in the industry. <br />
    In summary, while more programming practice is valuable, the time invested
    in core learning was well-spent as it provided invaluable insights, enhanced
    self-awareness, and emphasized the importance of people skills in the
    programming field.
