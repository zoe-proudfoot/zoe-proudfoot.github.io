        >This is my problem-solving blog. I found myself stuck more times than I
        would care to admit. But I would always find ways to solve 'em. Here's a
        few examples.</strong

    <h2><u>A time I was blocked on a simple problem:</u></h2>
    <p>
      During the initial stages of Foundations, I encountered numerous hurdles
      that impeded my progress. One instance that stands out vividly is the time
      when I faced a roadblock while setting up Visual Studio Code, the platform
      where I bring my ideas to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I distinctly remember the day I embarked on configuring Visual Studio
      Code; the terminal's settings checker was significantly flawed, leading to
      frustration as it failed to fulfill my expectations. At that moment, I
      realized I needed to take a step back and distance myself from the
      computer to regain clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a break allowed me to clear my mind and approach the problem with a
      fresh perspective. Returning to the task at hand, I approached the
      troubleshooting process with renewed determination. By methodically
      examining the issue, I eventually identified the root cause and
      effectively resolved it, restoring my workflow to full functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experience taught me the importance of stepping away from a problem
      when faced with roadblocks. Sometimes, a brief respite can provide the
      mental clarity necessary to overcome challenges and find successful
      solutions.
    </p>
    <h2><u>When I "Elegantly" solved a problem:</u></h2>
    <p>
      Let me confess upfront that elegance doesn't necessarily define my
      problem-solving style. In fact, I often stumble through challenges with a
      touch of awkwardness, which I like to attribute to my personal charm, the
      Zoe Proudfoot way. Nonetheless, there have been numerous occasions when
      frustration pushed me to the brink of launching my computer down the
      street. However, I've developed a strategy to cope with such moments
      without causing any harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever I find myself stuck and on the verge of a tech-induced meltdown,
      I've learned the value of stepping away and taking a short break. This
      brief pause allows me to gather my thoughts and regain composure, avoiding
      any potential damage to my devices or surroundings. During these moments
      of frustration, my trusty companion, Google, often comes to the rescue.
      I've come to rely on it as a go-to resource, and it has quickly become my
      digital best friend, providing me with quick tips and solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there are instances where even Google fails to provide the
      answers I seek. In those desperate times, I turn to ChatGPT for hints and
      guidance. More often than not, it proves to be a valuable ally, offering
      insights and assisting me in overcoming obstacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the going gets really tough, and the problem persists, I find
      solace in seeking help from the #tech-questions channel on the Discord
      Server. Engaging with my fellow learners and seeking their expertise has
      proven invaluable. Their collective knowledge and willingness to lend a
      hand have enabled me to conquer even the most daunting challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, while my approach may not always be elegant, I have discovered
      a reliable arsenal of resources and support channels that have proven
      instrumental in navigating the complexities of problem-solving.
    </p>
    <h2><u>How confident was I with these methods?</u></h2>
    <p>
      I possessed a strong sense of confidence in the methods I employed to
      tackle challenging situations. More often than not, these approaches
      proved to be effective in helping me overcome obstacles and navigate
      through tough spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it came to seeking answers from Google, I felt reassured in the vast
      knowledge and resources available at my fingertips. It became a reliable
      source of information and guidance, offering me quick solutions to many of
      my queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, turning to ChatGPT for hints and assistance instilled me with a
      sense of assurance. The AI-powered model consistently provided valuable
      insights and suggestions, contributing to my overall problem-solving
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, engaging with the #tech-questions channel on the Discord Server
      further bolstered my confidence. The willingness of fellow learners to
      offer support and share their expertise created a supportive environment
      that motivated me to persist in finding solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I acknowledged that not every problem could be resolved
      effortlessly, I remained optimistic and determined in my ability to
      overcome challenges. This confidence in my chosen methods served as a
      driving force, enabling me to navigate through tough situations and emerge
      with a sense of accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, I held a high level of confidence in the effectiveness of the
      methods I employed, and this confidence was validated by the positive
      outcomes and successful resolutions I experienced most of the time.
    </p>
    <h2><u>A time where I was reluctant to ask for help:</u></h2>
    <p>
      It's safe to say that my default stance has always been reluctance when it
      comes to seeking help. Whether it's driven by anxiety or other factors,
      the act of asking for assistance has never come naturally to me. However,
      during these past weeks, I've noticed a positive shift in my mindset, as
      I've grown increasingly comfortable with reaching out for support when
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This newfound willingness to ask for help stems from a realization that I
      am on a learning journey. Reminding myself that it's perfectly okay to
      seek guidance has been pivotal in breaking through my initial reluctance.
      I've come to understand that reaching out for assistance not only
      accelerates my growth but also provides an opportunity to connect with
      others who share a passion for learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it may not always be easy, I've learned to embrace the fact that
      seeking help is not a sign of weakness, but rather a testament to my
      commitment to self-improvement. Recognizing that no one becomes an expert
      overnight and that everyone benefits from collaboration and support has
      been a vital lesson on this journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I continue to progress, I strive to maintain this newfound comfort in
      asking for help. I understand that it is a strength to recognize my
      limitations and actively seek assistance when required. By fostering a
      supportive and collaborative environment, I am confident that I can
      overcome challenges more effectively and make the most of my learning
      experience.
