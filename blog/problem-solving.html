    <h1>The Problem Solving Blog</h1>
    <p>
      <strong
        >This is my problem-solving blog. I found myself stuck more times than I
        would care to admit. But I would always find ways to solve 'em. Here's a
        few examples.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <h2><u>A time I was blocked on a simple problem:</u></h2>
    <p>
      A lot of the setting up process at the start of Foundations was full of
      blockages for me. The first one was waiting on my laptop to arrive so that
      I could start working. I remember the day I was setting up Visual Studio
      Code (where i make the cool stuff happen &#x1F609;) in particular. The
      settings checker in the terminal was missing a lot and I felt myself
      getting frustrated because it wasn't doing what I wanted it to do. What I
      did that day was I stepped away from the computer for a while and had a
      break. When I came back to it with a fresh mind, I was able to
      troubleshoot and fix the issue. &#x1F918;
    </p>
    <h2><u>When I "Elegantly" solved a problem:</u></h2>
    <p>
      I'm gonna fess and say I'm not a very "Elegant" person. in fact, I get
      through most of my issues with a lot of awkward. But that's the Zoe
      Proudfoot charm. But I suppose there were many instances where I felt
      myself wanting to launch the computer down the street. But, like I said
      before, I walk away and take a short break most of the times where I'm
      frustrated instead of damaging things. But I suppose for the times I have
      found myself getting stuck and needing a quick tip, I would visit Google
      for answers. I have a feeling Google is going to become my bestie over the
      rest of this course. But if Google wasn't helping, I would as ChatGPT for
      some hints and most of the time, it came through. But if I got really,
      REALLY stuck, I would go to the #tech-questions on the Discord Server and
      ask my fellows for some help.
    </p>
    <h2><u>How confident was I with these methods?</u></h2>
    <p>
      I felt confident with these methods, and most of the time, I was able to
      get out of these tough spots.
    </p>
    <h2><u>A time where I was reluctant to ask for help:</u></h2>
    <p>
      I think the real question should be when am I <em>not </em>reluctant to
      ask for help. I don't know if that's due to my anxiety or other factors,
      but I've always been somewhat reluctant to ask for help. But over these
      past weeks, I have felt myself getting more comfortable in asking for help
      when I've needed it. I just have to remind myself that I am learning and
      that it is OK to ask for help when I need it.
