    <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
    <h3>An Anology on JavaScript and it's relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>
      First, let’s imagine a house as an analogy to describe the relationship
      between JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML can be compared to the structure and the layout of a house. It
      defines the basic elements like walls, doors, windows, and rooms. It
      provides the foundation for the house, just like HTML provides the
      structure for a web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS, on the other hand, is like the interior design of the house. It
      determines how the house looks and feels. CSS adds colors, styles, and
      visual effects to the HTML structure. It makes the house visually
      appealing and gives it a unique personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, JavaScript can be seen as the homeowner who adds functionality to the
      house. The homeowner can interact with different elements of the house,
      like opening and closing doors, turning lights on and off, or playing
      music. Similarly, JavaScript allows you to add interactivity and dynamic
      behavior to your web page. It enables you to respond to user actions,
      handle forms, create animations, and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the homeowner brings life and functionality to the house,
      JavaScript brings interactivity and dynamic features to your web page,
      making it more engaging and responsive to user interactions.
    </p>
    <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
    <p>
      Control flow refers to the order in which different steps are executed in
      a program or process. It determines theu flow or sequence of actions to be
      taken. In the context of making a sandwich, control flow would be the
      logical order in which you perform each step.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Here’s an example of control flow while making a sandwich:</u>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gather the ingredients (bread, cheese, lettuce, and tomato).</li>
      <li>Place two slices of bread on a plate.</li>
      <li>Spread mayonnaise on one slice of bread.</li>
      <li>Add cheese, lettuce and tomato on top of the mayonnaise.</li>
      <li>Place the second slice of bread on top to complete the sandwich.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this case, each step must be followed in a specific order to achieve
      the desired result. The control flow ensures that the steps are executed
      sequentially, one after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let’s move on to loops. A loop is a programming c onstruct that allows
      you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times until a specific
      condition is met. In everyday life, a good example of a loop would be
      “spreading butter on each slice of bread.”
    </p>
    <p><u>Here's an example of a loop while making a sandwich:</u></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gather the ingredients (bread, butter, and cheese).</li>
      <li>Place two slices of bread on a plate.</li>
      <li>Take a knife and scoop a small amount of butter.</li>
      <li>Spread the butter on one slice of bread.</li>
      <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the second slice of bread.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this case, the loop is formed by repeating the process of scooping
      butter and spreading it on each side of bread. The loop continues until
      both slices of bread have been buttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, in programming, loops allow you to repeat a block of code until
      a certain condition is met. They are useful for performing repetitive
      tasks efficiently without writing the same code multiple times.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, just as you repeat the process of spreading butter on each slice of
      bread when making a sandwich, loops in programming enable you to repeat a
      set of instructions until a specific condition is satisfied.
    </p>
    <h3>The DOM</h3>
    <p>
      The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
      documents. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a
      tree-like structure, where each element, attribute, and text node in the
      document is represented as an object. The DOM allows you to interact with
      and manipulate the content, structure, and styling of a web page
      dynamically using JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand the DOM better, let's consider an example of interacting
      with it:
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine you have a web page with a button and a paragraph element. You
      want to change the text of the paragraph when the button is clicked.
      Here's how you can use the DOM to achieve that: <br />
      <strong>HTML:</strong>
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://github.com/zoe-proudfoot/zoe-proudfoot.github.io/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(35).png?raw=true"
    />
    <p>
      <strong>JavaScript</strong>
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://github.com/zoe-proudfoot/zoe-proudfoot.github.io/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(36).png?raw=true"
    />
    <p>
      In this example, we first use the `document.getElementById()` method to
      retrieve references to the button and paragraph elements by their
      respective IDs. These methods allow us to access specific elements within
      the DOM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, we attach an event listener to the button using the
      `addEventListener()` method. This listener waits for a "click" event to
      occur on the button.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the button is clicked, the anonymous function inside the event
      listener is executed. Within this function, we use the `textContent`
      property of the paragraph element to change its text to "Updated Text".
    </p>
    <h3>Accessing Data From Arrays and Objects</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Arrays:</em><br />
      An array is an ordered collection of values, where each value is assigned
      a numeric index starting from 0. Here are some key points regarding
      accessing data from arrays.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Accessing Elements: </strong>You can access individual elements
        of an array using their index. For example, <em>`myArray[0]`</em> would
        give you the value at the first index <em>(index 0)</em> of the array.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Iterating through Elements: </strong>Arrays are typically used
        when you have a collection of similar values. You can easily iterate
        over an array using loops like <em>`for`</em> or <em>`forEach`</em>.
        This allows you to access each element in the array sequentially.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Iterating through Properties: </strong>Objects are typically
        used when you have a collection of related properties or attributes.
        Unlike arrays, there is no built-in method for directly iterating
        through all the properties of an object. However, you can use a
        <em>'for...in'</em> loop or other methods to iterate through the keys or
        properties of an object.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dynamic Property Names: </strong>Object properties can be
        dynamically accessed using variables or expressions. For example,
        <em>'myObject[propertyNameVariable]' </em>allows you to access a
        property whose name is stored in a variable.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In summary, arrays are ideal for working with an ordered collection of
      similar values and accessing elements by numeric indecies. Objects, on the
      other handm are suitable for storing related properties or attributes and
      accessing data using descriptive property names.
    </p>
    <h3>Functions and Why They're Usefule</h3>
    <p>
      Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task or a
      set of instructions. They allow you to encapsulate a piece of code into a
      named unit, making it easier to organize and manage your code. Functions
      can accept input values called arguments or parameters, and they can also
      return a value as an output.
    </p>
    <p><u>Here are a few reasons why functions are helpful:</u></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Code Reusability: </strong>Functions promote reusability, which
        means you can define a function once and use it multiple times
        throughout your codebase. Instead of writing the same code repeatedly,
        you can call the function whenever you need to perform a specific task,
        reducing redundancy and making your code more concise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Modularity and Organisation: </strong>Functions allow you to
        break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. By dividing
        your code into logical functions, you can achieve modularity, making it
        easier to understand, maintain, and update. Each function focuses on a
        specific task, making your code more organized and readable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Abstraction and Encapsulation: </strong>Functions provide a
        level of abstraction by hiding the implementation details of a task
        behind a function name and interface. This allows you to use the
        function without needing to understand how it works internally.
        Functions encapsulate a set of instructions, allowing you to isolate and
        separate different parts of your code, promoting clean and maintainable
        code architecture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Code Readability: </strong>Functions can enhance the readability
        of your code. By giving meaningful names to functions, it becomes easier
        to understand what a particular piece of code does just by looking at
        its function call. Functions can also include comments that further
        clarify their purpose, making the code more understandable for yourself
        and others who might work with your code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reusability across Projects: </strong>Functions can be written
        and saved in separate files or modules. This means that well-designed
        functions can be reused in different projects, saving you time and
        effort. Functions can be shared across teams or even open-source
        communities, allowing developers to benefit from each other's work and
        contributions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In summary, functions provide code reusability, modularity, abstraction,
      encapsulation, and improved code readability. They are a fundamental
      concept in programming that promotes efficient and maintainable code
      development.
