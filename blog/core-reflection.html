    <h1>Core Reflection</h1>
    <h2>
      <strong><u>Sprint One</u></strong>
    </h2>
    <h3><u>Thinking Like a Web Developer:</u></h3>
    <p>
      Thinking like a web developer involves approaching problems analytically,
      breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts, and devising efficient
      and logical solutions. As a newcomer to development, I initially faced
      some challenges in adopting this mindset. However, over time, I have made
      significant progress and look forward to further refining these skills
      throughout my time in the boot camp
    </p>
    <h3><u>Identity and Values Exploration:</u></h3>
    <p>
      During the Foundations course, I engaged in extensive self-reflection,
      which helped reawaken my dormant creative side. Crafting blogs and
      designing them using CSS brought me immense satisfaction. Additionally, I
      had ample opportunities to discuss my experiences with autism, something I
      rarely get to do. It felt liberating to open up about it and address the
      associated struggles.
    </p>
    <h3><u>Introduce Yourself Exercise:</u></h3>
    <p>
      At first, I hesitated and almost decided against participating in the
      'Introduce Yourself' exercise. Nonetheless, completing it provided a sense
      of relief and accomplishment. Although it remains a personal challenge, I
      recognize that it's an area where I can continually work on.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong><u>Sprint Two</u></strong>
    </h2>
    <h3><u>My Learning Plan:</u></h3>
    <p>
      I didn't start with a detailed learning plan as I tend to prefer a more
      flexible approach, adapting to circumstances as they arise. However, I
      have set a long-term goal of securing a good job upon completion of this
      course. I firmly believe that I'm still on track to achieve that
      objective.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong><u>Sprint Three</u></strong>
    </h2>
    <h3><u>Emotional Intelligence</u></h3>
    <p>
      Initially, I had doubts about my level of emotional intelligence. However,
      conducting research on the subject revealed that I do possess some
      emotional intelligence. Although improvement is necessary, developing
      emotional intelligence is similar to learning to ride a bike or drive a
      carâ€”it requires practice.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong><u>Sprint Four</u></strong>
    </h2>
    <h3><u>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset:</u></h3>
    <p>
      Exploring the concept of neuroplasticity and embracing a growth mindset
      has been one of the highlights of the core research. I genuinely believe
      that I have a growth mindset as I find joy in acquiring new knowledge and
      remain open to new experiences. Learning is an ongoing process that allows
      us to continue growing even after our physical growth has ceased. I
      eagerly anticipate further learning and personal growth during my time at
      Dev Academy.
    </p>
    <h3><u>Listening and Looping:</u></h3>
    <p>
      I found the listening part of this exercise relatively easy because I
      naturally possess good listening skills. However, I encountered
      difficulties when it came to speaking. I found it challenging and often
      stumbled over my words. Nevertheless, I gave it my best effort, and as a
      result, I can now reflect on the experience and articulate it effectively.
