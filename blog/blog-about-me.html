    <h1>Welcome to My Intro Blog :)</h1>
    <h2>I am going to use this space to introduce myself.</h2>
    <h3>Where I'm from and where I've grown up.</h3>
    <p>
      I was born right here in Gisborne, Aotearoa New Zealand in 1999. I have
      lived here for most of my life, while also spending a few portions of my
      childhood living in Wairoa and Flaxmere, I felt most at home here on the
      East Coast.<br />
      When I finished highschool, I moved down to Napier for two years to chase
      my creative passion, but wound up moving home to be with my family when we
      were going through some hard times.
    </p>
    <h3>What have I done, and what brought me here to Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
      As I mentioned before, I have studied the arts before and have a creative
      background. In 2018, I took this creativity down to the beautiful Hawke's
      Bay and studied my level 3 & 4 Arts Certificates and spent majority of the
      next year doing my level 5 Diploma. I came back home near the end of 2019.
      I spent majority of 2020 in lockdown with the rest of the world. In about
      September of that year, I got my first job working in the kiwifruit
      orchards on the outskirts of Gizzy. I spent about three seasons doing that
      and loved it for the most part, but felt like I was missing something in
      my life. <br />
      I came across Dev Academy via an email from MSD (WINZ) that caught my
      attention straight away, I did all the neccersary stuff and now, here I
      am, telling my life's story almost. I have pretty high hopes for this
      course, but so far in these first two sprints, I have loved learning about
      HTML. The CSS is where it's at for my inner designer though. I hope that
      this will help me to channel my creativity into something positive and
      give me an awesome career as well!
    </p>
    <h3>What are my career goals?</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of this course, I am hoping to become either a website
      developer or a website designer. As much as I would absolutely love to own
      a business doing this on my own, I would be happy to work for a company
      while I get better and better at this stuff.
