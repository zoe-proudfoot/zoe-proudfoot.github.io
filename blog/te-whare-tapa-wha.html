    <h3>How am I going to put these into practice?</h3>
    <h4><u>Taha Tinana (Pysical Wellbeing)</u></h4>
    <p>
      I have started to make a habit of walking my dog on any day that it's not
      raining. I suppose I will carry that on for my physical wellbeing. The
      exercise is also mutually beneficial for the two of us. I do need to work
      on my sleep schedule, in terms of getting my 8 hours.
    </p>
    <h4><u>Taha Hinegaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</u></h4>
    <p>
      Practicing self-care. I will engage in relaxing activities, such as
      reading, listening to music and all of that good stuff. I will also
      journal/write down when I am really stressed. I will also try and find a
      good work/life balance. Also, despite how many times I've said it in the
      past, I will seek help if I need to.
    </p>
    <h4><u>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</u></h4>
    <p>
      Connecting with nature. I believe walks along our beautiful Gizzy beaches
      and such would be great. Cultivate gratitude. I have a habit of stopping
      to appreciate the small things in life, so I will carry on with that.
      Altruism and helping others. I suppose I should have put this in my intro
      blog, but I have done many hours of voulentary work. At the Riding For the
      Disabled, and also at the SPCA. I suppose, I could help people when I have
      the mental capacity and the time to do so, because it does make me feel
      good.
    </p>
    <h4><u>Taha Wh훮nau (family wellbeing)</u></h4>
    <p>
      Healthy boundaries. I suppose this is moreso for myself as I have always
      been a yes person to avoid conflict. So I guess, I need to learn to say no
      a little more. Emotional support. Be there to support my family
      emotionally. And communicate effectively. I don't have an explination for
      that, but I see its importance.
    </p>
    <h4><u>Whenua (land)</u></h4>
    <p>
      I will take steps to conserve natural resources and look after my
      environment. I will also take whatever opportunity I can to connect with
      nature.
