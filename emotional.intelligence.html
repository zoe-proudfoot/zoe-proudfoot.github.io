    <h3><strong>What is emotional intelligence?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to recognize,
      understand, and manage emotions, both in oneself and in others. It
      encompasses a set of skills and compentencies that enable induviduals to
      navigate their own emotions effectively and to empathize with and
      influence the emotions of others.
    </p>

    <p>
      The concept of emotional intellegce was popularized by psychologists Peter
      Salovey and John Mayer in the 1990s and further developed by Daniel
      Goleman in his influental book "Emotional Intellegence" published in 1995.
      According to Goleman, emotional intellegence consists of five key
      components:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Self-awareness:</strong> The ability to recognize and understand
        one's own feelings and having realistic assessment of oneself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Self-regulation:</strong> The capacity to manage and control
        one's emotions, impulses and reactions. This includes the ability to
        stay calm under pressure, adapt to changing circumstances, and restrain
        negative or disruptive behaviors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Motivation:</strong> The drive to achieve goals, pursue personal
        growth, and perrsist in the face of obstacles. Motivated induviduals are
        often self-directed, have a positive outlook, and are resiliant in the
        face of setbacks
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Empathy:</strong> The skill of understanding and sharing the
        feelings, perspectives and experiences of others. Empathy involves
        actively listening, showing compassion and being able to put oneself in
        someone else's shoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social skills:</strong> The ability to build and maintain
        positive relationships, communticate effectively, and work
        collaboratively with others. This includes skills such as actively
        listening, conflict resolution, teamwork, and leadership.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Emotional intellegence is considered valuble in personal and professional
      contexts. It can enhace communication, foster stronger relationships,
      improve decision-making, and contribute to overall well-being. Developing
      emotional intellegence involves self-reflection, and the cultivation of
      empathy and social skills through practice and learning.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>How is EQ different to IQ?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      EQ, or <em>emotional intellegence quotant</em>, and IQ, or
      <em>intellegent quotant</em> are two different measures of human
      capabilties that focus on different aspects of intellegence.
    </p>
    <or>
      <li>
        <strong>IQ (Intelligence Quotant):</strong> IQ is a measure of cognitive
        intelligence, which referes to a person's intellectual capacity,
        problem-solving abilities, logical reasoning, memory, and other
        cognitive skills. It is typically measured through standardized tests
        that asssess various cognitive abilities, such as verbal comprehension,
        mathmatical reasoning, and spacial reasoning. IQ is often considered a
        measure of academic and intellectual potential.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>EQ (Emotional Intelligence Quotant):</strong> EQ, on the other
        hand, measures emotional intellegence, which relates to a person's
        ability to understand, manage, and express emotions effectively. It
        involves recognizing and understanding to navigate social interactions
        and relationships. EQ encomapsses skills such as self-awareness,
        self-regulation, empathy, motivation, and social skills.
      </li>
    </or>
    <p>
      While IQ focuses primarily on cognitive abilities, EQ focuses on emotional
      and social abilties. Here are some key differences between EQ and IQ:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Nature VS Nurture:</strong> IQ is thought to be relatively
        stable throughout a person's life and is influenced by genetic factors.
        It is often considered a more innate and hereditary trait. In contrast,
        EQ is believed to be more malleable and can be developed and improved
        through self-awareness, learning, and practice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Measurement:</strong> IQ is typically measured through
        standardized tests, such as the Wechsler Adult Itellegence Scale (WAIS),
        which provide a numerical score that represents a person's intellectual
        abilities. EQ, however does not have a universally accepted standardized
        test. It is often assessed through self-report questionnaires,
        360-degree assessments, or observations of behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Focus:</strong> IQ primarily focuses on cognitive abilties such
        as logical reasoning and problem solving. It is closely associated with
        academic achievement and success in traditional educational settings.
        EQ, on the other hand, centers on emotional and social abilities, such
        as empathy, interpersonal communication, and self-management. It is
        particularly relevant in social and emotional contexts, including
        personal relationships, leadership, and teamwork.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Real-World-Application:</strong> While IQ can predict academic
        and technical performance to some extent. EQ is often considered more
        relevant for success in interpersonal relationships, leadership
        postitions, and overall well-being. EQ can help induviduals navigate
        social complexities, manage conflicts, inspire and influence others, and
        develop resilience in the face of challenges.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It's important to note that IQ and EQ are not mutually exclusive, and both
      types of intelligence contribute to a person's overall capabilites. Each
      plays a unique role in different aspects of life, and a balanced
      combination of cognitive and emotional intellegence can lead to
      well-rounded personal and professional development.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Why is EQ important?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence (EQ) is important for several reasons, as it plays
      a significant role in various aspects of life. Here are some key reasons
      why EQ is important:
    </p>

        engagement, and productivity.
      </li>
      <li>

        skills needed to handle conflicts and disagreements constructively. By

        induviduals with high EQ can find common ground, facilitate comprimise,
        and seek win-win solutions. They can navigate conflicts with empathy and
